first figure is woody biomass and elevation overview

discuss the first variables that become clear from the woody plot (for me:):
- elevation
- slope
- soil

Try to find another cool prediction variable -> so another EE map (bonus points!)

cec is not too much related to rainfall, more to elevation as high cec is caused by high vulcanic ash concentrations
change model according to this issue

piecewise SEM values need to be standardized!
